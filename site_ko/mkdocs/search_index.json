We suggest you to layout your deployment as follows :\n\n\n\nmkdir haiwen\nmv seafile-server_* haiwen\ncd haiwen\n# after moving seafile-server_* to this directory\ntar -xzf seafile-server_*\nmkdir installed\nmv seafile-server_* installed\n\n\n\n\nNow you should have the following directory layout\n\n\n\ntree haiwen -L 2\n\n\nhaiwen\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 installed\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 seafile-server_1.8.2_x86-64.tar.gz\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 seafile-server-1.8.2\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 reset-admin.sh\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 runtime\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 seafile\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 seafile.sh\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 seahub\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 seahub.sh\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup-seafile.sh\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 upgrade\n\n\n\nThe benefit of this layout is that:\n\n\n\n\nWe can place all the config files for Seafile server inside \"haiwen\" directory, making it easier to manage.\n\n\nWhen you upgrade to a new version of Seafile, you can simply untar the latest package into \"haiwen\" directory. In this way you can reuse the existing config files in \"haiwen\" directory and don't need to configure again.\n\n\n\n\nMySQL \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \uc900\ube44\n\n\nThree components of Seafile Server need their own databases:\n\n\n\n\nccnet \uc11c\ubc84\n\n\nseafile \uc11c\ubc84\n\n\nseahub\n\n\n\n\nSeafile \uc11c\ubc84 \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub354 \uc54c\uc544\ubcf4\ub824\uba74 \nSeafile \uc11c\ubc84 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \ub458\ub7ec\ubcf4\uae30\n\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624.\n\n\nThere are two ways to intialize the databases:\n\n\n\n\nlet the \nsetup-seafile-mysql.sh\n script create the databases for you.\n\n\ncreate the databases by yourself, or someone else (the database admin, for example)\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend the first way. The script would ask you for the root password of the mysql server, and it will create:\n\n\n\n\nccnet/seafile/seahub \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\n\n\n\ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc0c8 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\n\n\n\n\nHowever, sometimes you have to use the second way. If you don't have the root password, you need someone who has the privileges, e.g., the database admin, to create the three databases, as well as a mysql user who can access the three databases for you. For example, to create three databases: \nccnet-db\n / \nseafile-db\n / \nseahub-db\n for ccnet/seafile/seahub respectively, and a mysql user \"seafile\" to access these databases:\n\n\n\ncreate database `ccnet-db` character set = 'utf8';\ncreate database `seafile-db` character set = 'utf8';\ncreate database `seahub-db` character set = 'utf8';\n\ncreate user 'seafile'@'localhost' identified by 'seafile';\n\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `ccnet-db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `seafile-db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `seahub-db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;\n\n\n\n\nSeafile \uc11c\ubc84 \uc124\uce58\n\n\n\uc120\ud589 \uacfc\uc815\n\n\nSeafile \uc11c\ubc84 \uafb8\ub7ec\ubbf8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc124\uce58\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c \uafb8\ub7ec\ubbf8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\n\n\npython 2.7\n\n\npython-setuptools\n\n\npython-imaging\n\n\npython-ldap\n\n\npython-mysqldb\n\n\npython-memcache (or python-memcached)\n\n\n\n\n\n# on Debian/Ubuntu\napt-get update\napt-get install python2.7 libpython2.7 python-setuptools python-imaging \\\n  python-ldap python-mysqldb python-memcache\n\n\n\n\n\n# on CentOS 7\nsudo yum install python-imaging MySQL-python python-memcached python-ldap\n\n\n\n\n\uc124\uc815\n\n\n\ncd seafile-server-*\n./setup-seafile-mysql.sh  #run the setup script \n&\n answer prompted questions\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the prerequisites are not installed, the seafile initialization script will ask you to install them.\n\n\n\uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc124\uc815 \uc635\uc158 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\n Seafile \uc124\uc815 \uc635\uc158 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nserver name\n\n\nName of this seafile server\n\n\n3-15 characters, only English letters, digits and underscore ('_') are allowed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nserver ip or domain\n\n\nThe IP address or domain name used by this server\n\n\nSeafile client program will access the server with this address\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseafile data dir\n\n\nSeafile stores your data in this directory.

There are two ways to intialize the databases:   let the  setup-seafile-mysql.sh  script create the databases for you.  create the databases by yourself, or someone else (the database admin, for example)   We recommend the first way. The script would ask you for the root password of the mysql server, and it will create:   ccnet/seafile/seahub \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4  \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc0c8 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790   However, sometimes you have to use the second way. If you don't have the root password, you need someone who has the privileges, e.g., the database admin, to create the three databases, as well as a mysql user who can access the three databases for you. For example, to create three databases:  ccnet-db  /  seafile-db  /  seahub-db  for ccnet/seafile/seahub respectively, and a mysql user \"seafile\" to access these databases:  \ncreate database `ccnet-db` character set = 'utf8';\ncreate database `seafile-db` character set = 'utf8';\ncreate database `seahub-db` character set = 'utf8';\n\ncreate user 'seafile'@'localhost' identified by 'seafile';\n\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `ccnet-db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `seafile-db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `seahub-db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;",

After the body is completely received, Nginx will send the body to the upstream server (seaf-server in our case). But it seems when file size is very large, the buffering mechanism dosen't work well. It may stop proxying the body in the middle.

For example, assume your are upgrading seafile server 1.3.0 to 1.4.0, then:\n\n\n  Alias /media  /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-1.4.0/seahub/media\n\n\n\n\nTip:\n\nYou can create a symbolic link \nseafile-server-latest\n, and make it point to your current seafile server folder (Since seafile server 2.1.0, the \nsetup-seafile.sh\n script will do this for you). Then, each time you run a upgrade script, it would update the \nseafile-server-latest\n symbolic link to keep it always point to the latest version seafile server folder.\n\n\nIn this case, you can write:\n\n\n  Alias /media  /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-latest/seahub;\n\n\n\n\nThis way, you no longer need to update the Apache config file each time you upgrade your seafile server.\n\n\nDetailed explanation\n\n\nThis may help you understand seafile server better: \nSeafile Components\n\n\nThere are two components in Seafile server, Seahub and FileServer. FileServer only servers for raw file uploading/downloading, it listens on 8082. Seahub that serving all the other pages, is still listen on 8000.

Then, each time you run a upgrade script, it would update the  seafile-server-latest  symbolic link to keep it always point to the latest version seafile server folder.  In this case, you can write:    Alias /media  /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-latest/seahub;  This way, you no longer need to update the Apache config file each time you upgrade your seafile server.",

If you're using Pro Edition, please refer to \nthe Seafile Pro documentation\n.\n\n\nSeafile\uc758 LDAP \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uad00\ub9ac \ub3d9\uc791 \ubc29\uc2dd\n\n\nWhen Seafile is integrated with LDAP/AD, users in the system can be divided into two tiers:\n\n\n\n\nUsers within Seafile's internal user database. Some attributes are attached to these users, such as whether it's a system admin user, whether it's activated. This tier includes two types of users:\n\n\nNative users: these users are created by the admin on Seafile's system admin interface. These users are stored in the \nEmailUser\n table of the \nccnet\n database.\n\n\nUsers imported from LDAP/AD server: When a user in LDAP/AD logs into Seafile, its information will be imported from LDAP/AD server into Seafile's database. These users are stored in the \nLDAPUsers\n table of the \nccnet\n database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers in LDAP/AD server. These are all the intended users of Seafile inside the LDAP server. Seafile doesn't manipulate these users directly. It has to import them into its internal database before setting attributes on them.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Seafile counts the number of users in the system, it only counts the \nactivated\n users in its internal database.\n\n\nWhen Seafile is integrated with LDAP/AD, it'll look up users from both the internal database and LDAP server. As long as the user exists in one of these two sources, they can log into the system.\n\n\nBasic LDAP/AD Integration\n\n\nThe only requirement for Seafile to use LDAP/AD for authentication is that there must be a unique identifier for each user in the LDAP/AD server. Seafile can only use email-address-format user identifiers. So there are usually only two options for this unique identifier:\n\n\n\n\nEmail address: this is the most common choice.

Seafile server (Community Edition \n= 4.1.0, Pro Edition \n= 4.0.6) supports authentication via Shibboleth. It allows users from another organization to log in to Seafile without registering an account on the service provider.\n\n\nIn this documentation, we assume the reader is familiar with Shibboleth installation and configuration. For introduction to Shibboleth concepts, please refer to https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/UnderstandingShibboleth .\n\n\nShibboleth Service Provider (SP) should be installed on the same server as the Seafile server. The official SP from https://shibboleth.net/ is implemented as an Apache module. The module handles all Shibboleth authentication details. Seafile server receives authentication information (username) from fastcgi. The username then can be used as login name for the user.\n\n\nSeahub provides a special URL to handle Shibboleth login. The URL is \nhttps://your-server/shib-login\n. Only this URL needs to be configured under Shibboleth protection. All other URLs don't go through the Shibboleth module. The overall workflow for a user to login with Shibboleth is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIn the Seafile login page, there is a separate \"Shibboleth\" login button. When the user clicks the button, she/he will be redirected to \nhttps://your-server/shib-login\n.\n\n\nSince that URL is controlled by Shibboleth, the user will be redirected to IdP for login. After the user logs in, she/he will be redirected back to \nhttps://your-server/shib-login\n.\n\n\nThis time the Shibboleth module passes the request to Seahub. Seahub reads the user information from the request and brings the user to her/his home page.\n\n\nAll later access to Seahub will not pass through the Shibboleth module. Since Seahub keeps session information internally, the user doesn't need to login again until the session expires.\n\n\n\n\nSince Shibboleth support requires Apache, if you want to use Nginx, you need two servers, one for non-Shibboleth access, another configured with Apache to allow Shibboleth login. In a cluster environment, you can configure your load balancer to direct traffic to different server according to URL.

            "text": "Shibboleth  is a widely used single sign on (SSO) protocol. Seafile server (Community Edition  = 4.1.0, Pro Edition  = 4.0.6) supports authentication via Shibboleth. It allows users from another organization to log in to Seafile without registering an account on the service provider.  In this documentation, we assume the reader is familiar with Shibboleth installation and configuration. For introduction to Shibboleth concepts, please refer to https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/UnderstandingShibboleth .  Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) should be installed on the same server as the Seafile server. The official SP from https://shibboleth.net/ is implemented as an Apache module. The module handles all Shibboleth authentication details. Seafile server receives authentication information (username) from fastcgi. The username then can be used as login name for the user.  Seahub provides a special URL to handle Shibboleth login. The URL is  https://your-server/shib-login . Only this URL needs to be configured under Shibboleth protection. All other URLs don't go through the Shibboleth module. The overall workflow for a user to login with Shibboleth is as follows:   In the Seafile login page, there is a separate \"Shibboleth\" login button. When the user clicks the button, she/he will be redirected to  https://your-server/shib-login .  Since that URL is controlled by Shibboleth, the user will be redirected to IdP for login. After the user logs in, she/he will be redirected back to  https://your-server/shib-login .  This time the Shibboleth module passes the request to Seahub. Seahub reads the user information from the request and brings the user to her/his home page.  All later access to Seahub will not pass through the Shibboleth module. Since Seahub keeps session information internally, the user doesn't need to login again until the session expires.   Since Shibboleth support requires Apache, if you want to use Nginx, you need two servers, one for non-Shibboleth access, another configured with Apache to allow Shibboleth login. In a cluster environment, you can configure your load balancer to direct traffic to different server according to URL. Only the URL  https://your-server/shib-login  needs to be directed to Apache.  The configuration includes 3 steps:   Install and configure Shibboleth Service Provider;  Configure Apache;  Configure Seahub.",

But for most people, the WAN IP address is likey to change regularly by their ISP(Internet Serice Provider), which makes this approach impratical.\n\nYou can use a dynamic DNS(DDNS) Service to overcome this problem. By using a dynamic DNS service, you can visit your seahub by domain name (instead of by IP), and the domain name will always be mapped to your WAN IP address, even if it changes regularly.\n\nThere are a dozen of dynmaic DNS service providers on the internet. If you don't know what service to choose We recommend using [www.noip.com](http://www.noip.com) since it performs well in our testing.\n\nThe detailed process is beyond the scope of this wiki. But basically, you should:\n\n1. Choose a DDNS service provider\n2. Register an account on the DDNS service provider's website\n3. Download a client from your DDNS service provider to keep your domain name always mapped to your WAN IP\n\n## Seafile \uc124\uc815 \uc218\uc815\n\nAfter you have setup your DDNS service, you need to modify the `ccnet.conf`:\n\n\n\n\n\nSERVICE_URL = http://\n:8000\n```\n\n\n\uc124\uc815 \uc218\uc815 \ud6c4 Seafile \uc11c\ubc84\ub97c \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624.",

But for most people, the WAN IP address is likey to change regularly by their ISP(Internet Serice Provider), which makes this approach impratical.\n\nYou can use a dynamic DNS(DDNS) Service to overcome this problem. By using a dynamic DNS service, you can visit your seahub by domain name (instead of by IP), and the domain name will always be mapped to your WAN IP address, even if it changes regularly.\n\nThere are a dozen of dynmaic DNS service providers on the internet. If you don't know what service to choose We recommend using [www.noip.com](http://www.noip.com) since it performs well in our testing.\n\nThe detailed process is beyond the scope of this wiki. But basically, you should:\n\n1. Choose a DDNS service provider\n2. Register an account on the DDNS service provider's website\n3. Download a client from your DDNS service provider to keep your domain name always mapped to your WAN IP\n\n## Seafile \uc124\uc815 \uc218\uc815\n\nAfter you have setup your DDNS service, you need to modify the `ccnet.conf`:  SERVICE_URL = http:// :8000\n```  \uc124\uc815 \uc218\uc815 \ud6c4 Seafile \uc11c\ubc84\ub97c \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624.",

If you're using Pro Edition, please refer to [the Seafile Pro documentation|../deploy_pro/using_ldap_pro.md].\n\n\nHow does LDAP User Management Works in Seafile\n\n\nWhen Seafile is integrated with LDAP/AD, users in the system can be divided into two tiers:\n\n\n\n\nUsers within Seafile's internal user database. Some attributes are attached to these users, such as whether it's a system admin user, whether it's activated. This tier includes two types of users:\n\n\nNative users: these users are created by the admin on Seafile's system admin interface. These users are stored in the \nEmailUser\n table of the \nccnet\n database.\n\n\nUsers imported from LDAP/AD server: When a user in LDAP/AD logs into Seafile, its information will be imported from LDAP/AD server into Seafile's database. These users are stored in the \nLDAPUsers\n table of the \nccnet\n database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers in LDAP/AD server. These are all the intended users of Seafile inside the LDAP server. Seafile doesn't manipulate these users directly. It has to import them into its internal database before setting attributes on them.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Seafile counts the user number in the system, it only counts the \nactivated\n users in its internal database.\n\n\nWhen Seafile is integrated with LDAP/AD, it'll look up users from both the internal database and LDAP server. As long as the user exists in one of these two sources, it can log into the system.\n\n\nBasic LDAP/AD Integration\n\n\nThe only requirement for Seafile to use LDAP/AD for authentication is that, there must be a unique identifier for each user in the LDAP/AD server. Seafile can only use email-address-format user identifiers. So there are usually only two options for this unique identifier:\n\n\n\n\nEmail address: this is the most common choice. Most organizations assign unique email address for each member.\n\n\nUserPrincipalName: this is a user attribute only available in Active Directory. It's format is \nuser-login-name@domain-name\n, e.g. \njohn@example.com\n. It's not a real email address, but it works fine as the unique identifier.\n\n\n\n\nConnecting to Active Directory\n\n\nTo use AD to authenticate user, please add the following lines to ccnet.conf.\n\n\nIf you choose email address as unique identifier:\n\n\n[LDAP]\nHOST = 192.168.1.123\nUSE_SSL = false\nBASE = cn=users,dc=example,dc=com\nUSER_DN = administrator@example.local\nPASSWORD = secret\nLOGIN_ATTR = mail\n\n\n\nIf you choose UserPrincipalName as unique identifier:\n\n\n[LDAP]\nHOST = 192.168.1.123\nUSE_SSL = false\nBASE = cn=users,dc=example,dc=com\nUSER_DN = administrator@example.local\nPASSWORD = secret\nLOGIN_ATTR = userPrincipalName\n\n\n\nMeaning of each config options:\n\n\n\n\nHOST: LDAP URL for the host. ldap://, ldaps:// and ldapi:// are supported. You can also include port number in the URL, like ldap://ldap.example.com:389. To use TLS, you should configure the LDAP server to listen on LDAPS port and specify ldaps:// here. More details about TLS will be covered below.\n\n\nBASE: The root distinguished name (DN) to use when running queries against the directory server. \nYou cannot use the root DN (e.g. dc=example,dc=com) as BASE\n.\n\n\nUSER_DN: The distinguished name of the user that Seafile will use when connecting to the directory server. This user should have sufficient privilege to access all the nodes under BASE. It's recommended to use a user in the administrator group.\n\n\nPASSWORD: Password of the above user.\n\n\nLOGIN_ATTR: The attribute used for user's unique identifier. Use \nmail\n or \nuserPrincipalName\n.\n\n\n\n\nTips for choosing BASE and USER_DN:\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the BASE, you first have to navigate your organization hierachy on the domain controller GUI.\n\n\nIf you want to allow all users to use Seafile, you can use 'cn=users,dc=yourdomain,dc=com' as BASE (with proper adjustment for your own needs).\n\n\nIf you want to limit users to a certain OU (Organization Unit), you run \ndsquery\n command on the domain controller to find out the DN for this OU. For example, if the OU is 'staffs', you can run 'dsquery ou -name staff'. More information can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD supports 'user@domain.name' format for the USER_DN option. For example you can use administrator@example.com for USER_DN. Sometime the domain controller doesn't recognize this format. You can still use \ndsquery\n command to find out user's DN. For example, if the user name is 'seafileuser', run \ndsquery user -name seafileuser\n. More information \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nConnecting to other LDAP servers\n\n\nPlease add the following options to ccnet.conf:\n\n\n[LDAP]\nHOST = 192.168.1.123\nUSE_SSL = false\nBASE = ou=users,dc=example,dc=com\nUSER_DN = cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com\nPASSWORD = secret\nLOGIN_ATTR = mail\n\n\n\nThe meaning of the options are the same as described in the previous section. With other LDAP servers, you can only use \nmail\n attribute as user's unique identifier.\n\n\nAdvanced LDAP/AD Integration Options\n\n\nMultiple BASE\n\n\nMultiple base DN is useful when your company has more than one OUs to use Seafile. You can specify a list of base DN in the \"BASE\" config. The DNs are separated by \";\", e.g. \nou=developers,dc=example,dc=com;ou=marketing,dc=example,dc=com\n\n\nAdditional Search Filter\n\n\nSearch filter is very useful when you have a large organization but only a portion of people want to use Seafile. The filter can be given by setting \"FILTER\" config. The value of this option follows standard LDAP search filter syntax (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746475(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\n\nThe final filter used for searching for users is \n(\n($LOGIN_ATTR=*)($FILTER))\n. \n$LOGIN_ATTR\n and \n$FILTER\n will be replaced by your option values.\n\n\nFor example, add the following line to LDAP config:\n\n\nFILTER = memberOf=CN=group,CN=developers,DC=example,DC=com\n\n\n\n\nThe final search filter would be \n(\n(mail=*)(memberOf=CN=group,CN=developers,DC=example,DC=com))\n\n\nNote that the cases in the above example is significant. The \nmemberOf\n attribute is only available in Active Directory.\n\n\nLimiting Seafile Users to a Group in Active Directory\n\n\nYou can use the FILTER option to limit user scope to a certain AD group.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you should find out the DN for the group. Again, we'll use \ndsquery\n command on the domain controller. For example, if group name is 'seafilegroup', run \ndsquery group -name seafilegroup\n.\n\n\nAdd following line to LDAP config:\n\n\n\n\nFILTER = memberOf={output of dsquery command}",

We recommend that you use Ubuntu 14.04 or CentOS 7 as your server.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu 14.04, you can use the following command to install all the dependency that Seafile requires at one time.\n\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre poppler-utils libpython2.7 python-pip \\\nmysql-server python-setuptools python-imaging python-mysqldb python-memcache python-ldap\n\n\nsudo pip install boto\n```\n\n\nCentOS 7:\n\n\n```\nwget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\nsudo python get-pip.py\nsudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk poppler-utils python-dev python-setuptools \\\npython-imaging MySQL-python mysql-server.x86_64 python-memcached python-ldap\n\n\nsudo pip install boto\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysqld start\n```\n\n\nFor more information please see bellow.\n\n\n\n\nMinimum System Requirement\n\n\n\n\nA Linux server with 2GB RAM\n\n\n\n\nInstall Java Runtime Environment (JRE)\n\n\nOn Ubuntu/Debian:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre\n\n\n\n\nOn CentOS/Red Hat:\n\n\nsudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk\n\n\n\n\nInstall poppler-utils\n\n\nWe need poppler-utils for full text search of pdf files.\n\n\nOn Ubuntu/Debian:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install poppler-utils\n\n\n\n\nOn CentOS/Red Hat:\n\n\nsudo yum install poppler-utils\n\n\n\n\nInstall Python libraries\n\n\nFirst make sure your have installed python 2.7\n\n\nsudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install boto\n\n\n\n\nIf you receive an error about \"Wheel installs require setuptools \n= ...\", run this between the pip and boto lines above\n\n\nsudo pip install setuptools --no-use-wheel --upgrade\n\n\n\n\nInstall libpython2.7 if you use Ubuntu 14.04\n\n\nsudo apt-get install libpython2.7\n\n\n\n\nInstall other libraries as required in the community edition\n\n\nSee \nDownload and Setup Seafile Server With MySQL\n.\n\n\nDownload and Setup Seafile Professional Server\n\n\nGet the license\n\n\nPut the license you get under the top level diretory. In our wiki, we use the diretory \n/data/haiwen/\n as the top level directory.\n\n\nDownload/Uncompress Seafile Professional Server\n\n\ntar xf seafile-pro-server_1.8.0_x86-64.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\nNow you have:\n\n\nhaiwen\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 seafile-license.txt\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 seafile-pro-server-1.8.0/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should notice the difference between the names of the Community Server and Professional Server. Take the 1.8.0 64bit version as an example:\n\n\n\n\nSeafile Community Server tarball is \nseafile-server_1.8.0_x86-86.tar.gz\n; After uncompressing, the folder is \nseafile-server-1.7.0\n\n\nSeafile Professional Server tarball is \nseafile-pro-server_1.8.0_x86-86.tar.gz\n; After uncompressing, the folder is \nseafile-pro-server-1.7.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nThe setup process of Seafile Professional Server is the same as the Seafile Community Server. See \nDownload and Setup Seafile Server With MySQL\n.\n\n\nIf you have any problem in setting up the service, please check \nCommon problems in setting up Seafile server\n.\n\n\nAfter you have succesfully setup Seafile Professional Server, you would have a directory layout like this:\n\n\n#tree haiwen -L 2\nhaiwen\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 seafile-license.txt # license file\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ccnet               # configuration files\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 mykey.peer\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 PeerMgr\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 seafile.ini\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 conf\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ccnet.conf\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 seafile.conf\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 seahub_settings.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 seafevents.conf\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pro-data            # data specific for professional version\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 seafile-data\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 seafile-pro-server-1.8.0\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 reset-admin.sh\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 runtime\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 seafile\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 seafile.sh\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 seahub\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 seahub-extra\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 seahub.sh\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup-seafile.sh\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup-seafile-mysql.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup-seafile-mysql.sh\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 upgrade\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 seahub-data\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 avatars         # for user avatars\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 seahub.db\n\n\n\n\nPerformance turning\n\n\nIf you have more than 50 users in your Seafile system, we highly recommand you to \nadd memcached\n.

            "text": "Configure Seafile Pro Edition to use LDAP\n\n\nHow does LDAP User Management Works in Seafile\n\n\nWhen Seafile is integrated with LDAP/AD, users in the system can be divided into two tiers:\n\n\n\n\nUsers within Seafile's internal user database. Some attributes are attached to these users, such as whether it's a system admin user, whether it's activated. This tier includes two types of users:\n\n\nNative users: these users are created by the admin on Seafile's system admin interface. These users are stored in the \nEmailUser\n table of the \nccnet\n database.\n\n\nUsers imported from LDAP/AD server: When a user in LDAP/AD logs into Seafile, its information will be imported from LDAP/AD server into Seafile's database. These users are stored in the \nLDAPUsers\n table of the \nccnet\n database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers in LDAP/AD server. These are all the intended users of Seafile inside the LDAP server. Seafile doesn't manipulate these users directly. It has to import them into its internal database before setting attributes on them.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Seafile counts the user number in the system, it only counts the \nactivated\n users in its internal database.\n\n\nWhen Seafile is integrated with LDAP/AD, it'll look up users from both the internal database and LDAP server. As long as the user exists in one of these two sources, he/she can log into the system.\n\n\nBasic LDAP/AD Integration\n\n\nThe only requirement for Seafile to use LDAP/AD for authentication is that, there must be a unique identifier for each user in the LDAP/AD server. Seafile can only use email-address-format user identifiers. So there are usually only two options for this unique identifier:\n\n\n\n\nEmail address: this is the most common choice. Most organizations assign unique email address for each member.\n\n\nUserPrincipalName: this is a user attribute only available in Active Directory. It's format is \nuser-login-name@domain-name\n, e.g. \njohn@example.com\n. It's not a real email address, but it works fine as the unique identifier.\n\n\n\n\nConnecting to Active Directory\n\n\nTo use AD to authenticate user, please add the following lines to ccnet.conf.\n\n\nIf you choose email address as unique identifier:\n\n\n[LDAP]\nHOST = ldap://192.168.1.123/\nBASE = cn=users,dc=example,dc=com\nUSER_DN = administrator@example.local\nPASSWORD = secret\nLOGIN_ATTR = mail\n\n\n\nIf you choose UserPrincipalName as unique identifier:\n\n\n[LDAP]\nHOST = ldap://192.168.1.123/\nBASE = cn=users,dc=example,dc=com\nUSER_DN = administrator@example.local\nPASSWORD = secret\nLOGIN_ATTR = userPrincipalName\n\n\n\nMeaning of each config options:\n\n\n\n\nHOST: LDAP URL for the host. ldap://, ldaps:// and ldapi:// are supported. You can also include port number in the URL, like ldap://ldap.example.com:389. To use TLS, you should configure the LDAP server to listen on LDAPS port and specify ldaps:// here. More details about TLS will be covered below.\n\n\nBASE: The root distinguished name (DN) to use when running queries against the directory server. \nYou cannot use the root DN (e.g. dc=example,dc=com) as BASE\n.\n\n\nUSER_DN: The distinguished name of the user that Seafile will use when connecting to the directory server. This user should have sufficient privilege to access all the nodes under BASE. It's recommended to use a user in the administrator group.\n\n\nPASSWORD: Password of the above user.\n\n\nLOGIN_ATTR: The attribute used for user's unique identifier. Use \nmail\n or \nuserPrincipalName\n.\n\n\n\n\nTips for choosing BASE and USER_DN:\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the BASE, you first have to navigate your organization hierachy on the domain controller GUI.\n\n\nIf you want to allow all users to use Seafile, you can use 'cn=users,dc=yourdomain,dc=com' as BASE (with proper adjustment for your own needs).\n\n\nIf you want to limit users to a certain OU (Organization Unit), you run \ndsquery\n command on the domain controller to find out the DN for this OU. For example, if the OU is 'staffs', you can run 'dsquery ou -name staff'. More information can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD supports 'user@domain.name' format for the USER_DN option. For example you can use administrator@example.com for USER_DN. Sometime the domain controller doesn't recognize this format. You can still use \ndsquery\n command to find out user's DN. For example, if the user name is 'seafileuser', run \ndsquery user -name seafileuser\n. More information \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nConnecting to other LDAP servers\n\n\nPlease add the following options to ccnet.conf:\n\n\n[LDAP]\nHOST = ldap://192.168.1.123/\nBASE = ou=users,dc=example,dc=com\nUSER_DN = cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com\nPASSWORD = secret\nLOGIN_ATTR = mail\n\n\n\nThe meaning of the options are the same as described in the previous section. With other LDAP servers, you can only use \nmail\n attribute as user's unique identifier.\n\n\nTesting Your LDAP Configuration\n\n\nSince 5.0.0 Pro Edition, we provide a command line tool for checking your LDAP configuration.\n\n\nTo use this tool, make sure you have \npython-ldap\n package installed on your system.\n\n\nsudo apt-get install python-ldap\n\n\n\n\nThen you can run the test:\n\n\ncd seafile-server-latest\n./pro/pro.py ldapsync --test\n\n\n\n\nThe test script will test your LDAP settings under the \n[LDAP]\n section of ccnet.conf. If everything works, it'll print the first ten users in the search results. Otherwise, it'll print out possible errors in your config.\n\n\nSetting Up LADP/AD User Sync (Optional)\n\n\nIn Seafile Pro, except for importing users into internal database when they log in, you can also configure Seafile to periodically sync user information from LDAP/AD server into the internal database.\n\n\n\n\nUser's full name, department, contact email address can be synced to internal database. Users can use this information to more easily search for specific user.\n\n\nUser's Windows or Unix login id can be synced the internal database. This allows the user to log in with his/her familiar login id.\n\n\nWhen a user is removed from LDAP/AD, the corresponding user in Seafile will be deactivated. Otherwise, he/she can still sync files with Seafile client or access the web interface.\n\n\n\n\nAfter syncing is complete, you can see the user's full name, department and contact email on the user's profile page.\n\n\nActive Directory\n\n\nIf you're using Active Directory, add the following options to ccnet.conf:\n\n\n[LDAP]\n......\n\n[LDAP_SYNC]\nENABLE_USER_SYNC = true\nSYNC_INTERVAL = 60\nUSER_OBJECT_CLASS = person\nENABLE_EXTRA_USER_INFO_SYNC = true\nFIRST_NAME_ATTR = givenName\nLAST_NAME_ATTR = sn\nDEPT_ATTR = department\nUID_ATTR = sAMAccountName\n\n\n\n\nMeaning of each options:\n\n\n\n\nENABLE_USER_SYNC\n: set to \"true\" if you want to enable ldap user syncing\n\n\nSYNC_INTERVAL\n: The interval to sync. Unit is minutes. Default to 60 minutes.\n\n\nUSER_OBJECT_CLASS\n: This is the name of the class used to search for user objects. In Active Directory, it's usually \"person\". The default value is \"person\".\n\n\nENABLE_EXTRA_USER_INFO_SYNC\n: Enable syncing additional user information, including user full name, department, and Windows login name, etc.\n\n\nFIRST_NAME_ATTR\n: Attribute for user's first name. It's \"givenName\" by default.\n\n\nLAST_NAME_ATTR\n: Attribute for user's last name. It's \"sn\" by default.\n\n\nUSER_NAME_REVERSE\n: In some laguages, such as Chinese, the display order of first name and last name is reversed. Set this option if you need it.\n\n\nDEPT_ATTR\n: Attribute for user's department. It's \"department\" by default.\n\n\nUID_ATTR\n: Attribute for Windows login name. If this is synced, users can also log in with their Windows login name. In AD, the attribute \nsAMAccountName\n can be used as \nUID_ATTR\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose \nuserPrincipalName\n as the unique identifier for user, Seafile cannot use that as real email address to send notification emails to user. If the users in AD also have email address attributes, you can sync these email addresses into Seafile's internal database. Seafile can then use them to send emails. The configuration option is:\n- \nCONTACT_EMAIL_ATTR\n: usually you can set it to the \nmail\n attribute.\n\n\nOther LDAP servers\n\n\nAdd the following options to ccnet.conf:\n\n\n[LDAP]\n......\n\n[LDAP_SYNC]\nENABLE_USER_SYNC = true\nSYNC_INTERVAL = 60\nUSER_OBJECT_CLASS = userOfNames\nENABLE_EXTRA_USER_INFO_SYNC = true\nFIRST_NAME_ATTR = givenName\nLAST_NAME_ATTR = sn\nDEPT_ATTR = department\nUID_ATTR = uid\n\n\n\n\nMeaning of each options:\n\n\n\n\nENABLE_USER_SYNC\n: set to \"true\" if you want to enable ldap user syncing\n\n\nSYNC_INTERVAL\n: The interval to sync. Unit is minutes. Default to 60 minutes.\n\n\nUSER_OBJECT_CLASS\n: This is the name of the class used to search for user objects. In OpenLDAP, you can use \"userOfNames\". The default value is \"person\".\n\n\nENABLE_EXTRA_USER_INFO_SYNC\n: Enable syncing additional user information, including user full name, department, and Windows/Unix login name, etc.\n\n\nFIRST_NAME_ATTR\n: Attribute for user's first name. It's \"givenName\" by default.\n\n\nLAST_NAME_ATTR\n: Attribute for user's last name. It's \"sn\" by default.\n\n\nUSER_NAME_REVERSE\n: In some laguages, such as Chinese, the display order of first name and last name is reversed. Set this option if you need it.\n\n\nDEPT_ATTR\n: Attribute for user's department. It's \"department\" by default.\n\n\nUID_ATTR\n: Attribute for Windows/Unix login name. If this is synced, users can also log in with their Windows/Unix login name. In OpenLDAP, the attribute \nuid\n or something similar can be used.\n\n\n\n\nManually Trigger Syncing\n\n\nTo test your LDAP sync configuration, you can run the sync command manually.\n\n\nTo trigger LDAP sync manually,\n\n\ncd seafile-server-lastest\n./pro/pro.py ldapsync\n\n\n\n\nDon't Import New Users in LDAP Sync\n\n\nBy default, when LDAP sync process detects that a new user is added in the LDAP server, it'll automatically sync that user into internal database. And the new users will be activated by default. This will consume one more user license. \n\n\nLet's consider the following situation: you have a lot of users in the LDAP server, but you don't buy enough licenses to add all these users into Seafile. Enabling LDAP sync will consume all the licenses you buy and make your Seafile installation unusable. The ideal solution would be: new users are only added to Seafile when they log in for the first time. And LDAP sync only sync information from LDAP server for existing users. The following option is for this exact purpose:\n\n\n[LDAP_SYNC]\nIMPORT_NEW_USER = false\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced LDAP/AD Integration Options\n\n\nMultiple BASE\n\n\nMultiple base DN is useful when your company has more than one OUs to use Seafile. You can specify a list of base DN in the \"BASE\" config. The DNs are separated by \";\", e.g. \nou=developers,dc=example,dc=com;ou=marketing,dc=example,dc=com\n\n\nAdditional Search Filter\n\n\nSearch filter is very useful when you have a large organization but only a portion of people want to use Seafile. The filter can be given by setting \"FILTER\" config. The value of this option follows standard LDAP search filter syntax (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746475(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\n\nThe final filter used for searching for users is \n(\n($LOGIN_ATTR=*)($FILTER))\n. \n$LOGIN_ATTR\n and \n$FILTER\n will be replaced by your option values.\n\n\nFor example, add the following line to LDAP config:\n\n\nFILTER = memberOf=CN=group,CN=developers,DC=example,DC=com\n\n\n\n\nThe final search filter would be \n(\n(mail=*)(memberOf=CN=group,CN=developers,DC=example,DC=com))\n\n\nNote that the cases in the above example is significant. The \nmemberOf\n attribute is only available in Active Directory.\n\n\nLimiting Seafile Users to a Group in Active Directory\n\n\nYou can use the FILTER option to limit user scope to a certain AD group.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you should find out the DN for the group. Again, we'll use \ndsquery\n command on the domain controller. For example, if group name is 'seafilegroup', run \ndsquery group -name seafilegroup\n.\n\n\nAdd following line to LDAP config:\n\n\n\n\nFILTER = memberOf={output of dsquery command}\n\n\n\n\nUsing TLS connection to LDAP/AD server\n\n\nTo use TLS connection to the directory server, you should install a valid SSL certificate on the directory server.\n\n\nThe current version of Seafile Linux server package is compiled on CentOS. We include the ldap client library in the package to maintain compatibility with older Linux distributions. But since different Linux distributions have different path or configuration for OpenSSL library, sometimes Seafile is unable to connect to the directory server with TLS.\n\n\nThe ldap library (libldap) bundled in the Seafile package is of version 2.4. If your Linux distribution is new enough (like CentOS 6, Debian 7 or Ubuntu 12.04 or above), you can use system's libldap instead.\n\n\nOn Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 7/8, moving the bundled ldap related libraries out of the library path should make TLS connection work.\n\n\ncd ${SEAFILE_INSTALLATION_DIR}/seafile-server-latest/seafile/lib\nmkdir disabled_libs_use_local_ones_instead\nmv liblber-2.4.so.2 libldap-2.4.so.2 libsasl2.so.2 libldap_r-2.4.so.2 disabled_libs_use_local_ones_instead/\n\n\n\n\nOn CentOS 6, you have to move the libnssutil library:\n\n\ncd ${SEAFILE_INSTALLATION_DIR}/seafile-server-latest/seafile/lib\nmkdir disabled_libs_use_local_ones_instead\nmv libnssutil3.so disabled_libs_use_local_ones_instead/\n\n\n\n\nThis effectively removes the bundled libraries from the library search path. \nWhen the server starts, it'll instead find and use the system libraries (if they are installed). \nThis change has to be repeated after each update of the Seafile installation.\n\n\nUse paged results extension\n\n\nLDAP protocol version 3 supports \"paged results\" (PR) extension. When you have large number of users, this option can greatly improve the performance of listing users. Most directory server nowadays support this extension.\n\n\nIn Seafile Pro Edition, add this option to LDAP section of ccnet.conf to enable PR:\n\n\nUSE_PAGED_RESULT = true\n\n\n\n\nFollow referrals\n\n\nStarting from Pro Edition 4.0.4, Seafile supports auto following referrals in LDAP search. This is useful for partitioned LDAP or AD servers, where users may be spreaded on multiple directory servers. For more information about referrals, you can refer to \nthis article\n.\n\n\nTo configure, add following option to ccnet.conf in the [LDAP] section:\n\n\nFOLLOW_REFERRALS = true",

You can also include port number in the URL, like ldap://ldap.example.com:389. To use TLS, you should configure the LDAP server to listen on LDAPS port and specify ldaps:// here. More details about TLS will be covered below.  BASE: The root distinguished name (DN) to use when running queries against the directory server.  You cannot use the root DN (e.g. dc=example,dc=com) as BASE .  USER_DN: The distinguished name of the user that Seafile will use when connecting to the directory server. This user should have sufficient privilege to access all the nodes under BASE. It's recommended to use a user in the administrator group.  PASSWORD: Password of the above user.  LOGIN_ATTR: The attribute used for user's unique identifier. Use  mail  or  userPrincipalName .   Tips for choosing BASE and USER_DN:   To determine the BASE, you first have to navigate your organization hierachy on the domain controller GUI.  If you want to allow all users to use Seafile, you can use 'cn=users,dc=yourdomain,dc=com' as BASE (with proper adjustment for your own needs).  If you want to limit users to a certain OU (Organization Unit), you run  dsquery  command on the domain controller to find out the DN for this OU. For example, if the OU is 'staffs', you can run 'dsquery ou -name staff'. More information can be found  here .    AD supports 'user@domain.name' format for the USER_DN option. For example you can use administrator@example.com for USER_DN. Sometime the domain controller doesn't recognize this format. You can still use  dsquery  command to find out user's DN. For example, if the user name is 'seafileuser', run  dsquery user -name seafileuser . More information  here .",

This process is one-way.\n\n\n\n\nAny changes to groups in the database won't propagate back to LDAP;\n\n\nAny changes to groups in the database, except for \"setting a member as group admin\", will be overwritten in the next LDAP sync operation. If you want to add or delete members, you can only do that on LDAP server.\n\n\nThe creator of imported groups will be set to the system admin.\n\n\n\n\nSome LDAP servers, such as AD, allows setting a group as member of another group. This is called \"nested group\". Our process supports syncing nested groups. Supposed group B is a member of group A, the result would be: every member of group B will be imported as a member of both group A and group B.\n\n\nThere are two modes of operation:\n\n\n\n\nPeriodical: the syncing process will be executed in a fixed interval\n\n\nManual: there is a script you can run to trigger the syncing once\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisite\n\n\nYou have to install python-ldap library in your system.\n\n\nFor Debian or Ubuntu\n\n\nsudo apt-get install python-ldap\n\n\n\n\nFor CentOS or RedHat\n\n\nsudo yum install python-ldap\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nBefore enabling LDAP group sync, you should have configured LDAP authentication. See \nConfigure Seafile to use LDAP\n for details.\n\n\nThe following are LDAP group sync related options. They're in the \"[LDAP_SYNC]\" section of \nccnet.conf\n.\n\n\n\n\nENABLE_GROUP_SYNC\n: set to \"true\" if you want to enable ldap group syncing\n\n\nSYNC_INTERVAL\n: The interval to sync. Unit is minutes. Default to 60 minutes.\n\n\nGROUP_OBJECT_CLASS\n: This is the name of the class used to search for group objects. In Active Directory, it's usually \"group\"; in OpenLDAP or others, you may use \"groupOfNames\" or \"groupOfUniqueNames\", depends on your LDAP server. The default value is \"group\".\n\n\nGROUP_FILTER\n: An additional filter to use when searching group objects. If it's set, the final filter used to run search is \"(\n(objectClass=GROUP_OBJECT_CLASS)(GROUP_FILTER))\"; otherwise the final filter would be \"(objectClass=GROUP_OBJECT_CLASS)\".\n\n\nGROUP_MEMBER_ATTR\n: The attribute field to use when loading the group's members. For most directory servers, the attributes is \"member\", which is the default value.\n\n\n\n\nThe search base for groups is the \"BASE_DN\" set in \"[LDAP]\" section of ccnet.conf. \n\n\nHere is an example configuration for Active Directory:\n\n\n[LDAP]\nHOST = ldap://192.168.1.123/\nBASE = cn=users,dc=example,dc=com\nUSER_DN = administrator@example.local\nPASSWORD = secret\nLOGIN_ATTR = mail\n\n[LDAP_SYNC]\nENABLE_GROUP_SYNC = true\nSYNC_INTERVAL = 60\n\n\n\n\nFor AD, you usually don't need to configure other options except for \"ENABLE_GROUP_SYNC\". That's because the default values for other options are the usual values for AD. If you have special settings in your LDAP server, just set the corresponding options.\n\n\nHere is an example configuration for OpenLDAP:\n\n\n[LDAP]\nHOST = ldap://192.168.1.123/\nBASE = ou=users,dc=example,dc=com\nUSER_DN = cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com\nPASSWORD = secret\nLOGIN_ATTR = mail\n\n[LDAP_SYNC]\nENABLE_GROUP_SYNC = true\nSYNC_INTERVAL = 60\nGROUP_OBJECT_CLASS = groupOfNames\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Periodical sync won't happen immediately after you restart seafile server. It gets scheduled after the first sync interval. For example if you set sync interval to 30 minutes, the first auto sync will happen after 30 minutes you restarts. To sync immediately, you need to manually trigger it. This is covered in the next section.\n\n\nAfter the sync is run, you should see log messages like the following in logs/seafevents.log. And you should be able to see the groups in system admin page.\n\n\n[2015-03-30 18:15:05,109] [DEBUG] create group 1, and add dn pair CN=DnsUpdateProxy,CN=Users,DC=Seafile,DC=local\n-\n1 success.\n[2015-03-30 18:15:05,145] [DEBUG] create group 2, and add dn pair CN=Domain Computers,CN=Users,DC=Seafile,DC=local\n-\n2 success.\n[2015-03-30 18:15:05,154] [DEBUG] create group 3, and add dn pair CN=Domain Users,CN=Users,DC=Seafile,DC=local\n-\n3 success.\n[2015-03-30 18:15:05,164] [DEBUG] create group 4, and add dn pair CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=Seafile,DC=local\n-\n4 success.\n[2015-03-30 18:15:05,176] [DEBUG] create group 5, and add dn pair CN=RAS and IAS Servers,CN=Users,DC=Seafile,DC=local\n-\n5 success.\n[2015-03-30 18:15:05,186] [DEBUG] create group 6, and add dn pair CN=Enterprise Admins,CN=Users,DC=Seafile,DC=local\n-\n6 success.\n[2015-03-30 18:15:05,197] [DEBUG] create group 7, and add dn pair CN=dev,CN=Users,DC=Seafile,DC=local\n-\n7 success.\n\n\n\n\nManually Trigger Syncing\n\n\nTo trigger LDAP sync manually,\n\n\ncd seafile-server-lastest\n./pro/pro.py ldapsync",

            "text": "The importing or syncing process maps groups from LDAP directory server to groups in Seafile's internal database. This process is one-way.   Any changes to groups in the database won't propagate back to LDAP;  Any changes to groups in the database, except for \"setting a member as group admin\", will be overwritten in the next LDAP sync operation. If you want to add or delete members, you can only do that on LDAP server.  The creator of imported groups will be set to the system admin.   Some LDAP servers, such as AD, allows setting a group as member of another group. This is called \"nested group\". Our process supports syncing nested groups. Supposed group B is a member of group A, the result would be: every member of group B will be imported as a member of both group A and group B.  There are two modes of operation:   Periodical: the syncing process will be executed in a fixed interval  Manual: there is a script you can run to trigger the syncing once",

            "text": "Before enabling LDAP group sync, you should have configured LDAP authentication. See  Configure Seafile to use LDAP  for details.  The following are LDAP group sync related options. They're in the \"[LDAP_SYNC]\" section of  ccnet.conf .   ENABLE_GROUP_SYNC : set to \"true\" if you want to enable ldap group syncing  SYNC_INTERVAL : The interval to sync. Unit is minutes. Default to 60 minutes.  GROUP_OBJECT_CLASS : This is the name of the class used to search for group objects. In Active Directory, it's usually \"group\"; in OpenLDAP or others, you may use \"groupOfNames\" or \"groupOfUniqueNames\", depends on your LDAP server. The default value is \"group\".  GROUP_FILTER : An additional filter to use when searching group objects. If it's set, the final filter used to run search is \"( (objectClass=GROUP_OBJECT_CLASS)(GROUP_FILTER))\"; otherwise the final filter would be \"(objectClass=GROUP_OBJECT_CLASS)\".  GROUP_MEMBER_ATTR : The attribute field to use when loading the group's members. For most directory servers, the attributes is \"member\", which is the default value.   The search base for groups is the \"BASE_DN\" set in \"[LDAP]\" section of ccnet.conf.   Here is an example configuration for Active Directory:  [LDAP]\nHOST = ldap://192.168.1.123/\nBASE = cn=users,dc=example,dc=com\nUSER_DN = administrator@example.local\nPASSWORD = secret\nLOGIN_ATTR = mail\n\n[LDAP_SYNC]\nENABLE_GROUP_SYNC = true\nSYNC_INTERVAL = 60  For AD, you usually don't need to configure other options except for \"ENABLE_GROUP_SYNC\". That's because the default values for other options are the usual values for AD. If you have special settings in your LDAP server, just set the corresponding options.  Here is an example configuration for OpenLDAP:  [LDAP]\nHOST = ldap://192.168.1.123/\nBASE = ou=users,dc=example,dc=com\nUSER_DN = cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com\nPASSWORD = secret\nLOGIN_ATTR = mail\n\n[LDAP_SYNC]\nENABLE_GROUP_SYNC = true\nSYNC_INTERVAL = 60\nGROUP_OBJECT_CLASS = groupOfNames  NOTE  Periodical sync won't happen immediately after you restart seafile server. It gets scheduled after the first sync interval. For example if you set sync interval to 30 minutes, the first auto sync will happen after 30 minutes you restarts. To sync immediately, you need to manually trigger it. This is covered in the next section.  After the sync is run, you should see log messages like the following in logs/seafevents.log. And you should be able to see the groups in system admin page.

You can find the key_id and key in the \"security credentials\" section on your AWS account page.\n\n\nWhen creating your buckets on S3, please first read \nS3 bucket naming rules\n. Note especially not to use \nUPPERCASE\n letters in bucket names (don't use camel style names, such as MyCommitOjbects).\n\n\nUse S3 in newer regions\n\n\nAfter Januaray 2014, new regions of AWS will only support authentication signature version 4 for S3. At this time, new region includes Frankfurt and China.\n\n\nTo use S3 backend in these regions, add following options to commit_object_backend, fs_object_backend and block_backend section in seafile.conf\n\n\nuse_v4_signature = true\n# eu-central-1 for Frankfurt region\naws_region = eu-central-1\n\n\n\n\nFor file search and webdav to work with the v4 signature mechanism, you need to add following lines to ~/.boto\n\n\n[s3]\nuse-sigv4 = True\n\n\n\n\nUsing memcached cluster\n\n\nIn a cluster environment, you may want to use a memcached cluster. In the above configuration, you have to specify all the memcached server node addresses in seafile.conf\n\n\nmemcached_options = --SERVER=192.168.1.134 --SERVER=192.168.1.135 --SERVER=192.168.1.136 --POOL-MIN=10 --POOL-MAX=100\n\n\n\n\nUse HTTPS connections to S3\n\n\nSince Pro 5.0.4, you can use HTTPS connections to S3. Add the following options to seafile.conf:\n\n\n[commit_object_backend]\nname = s3\n......\nuse_https = true\n\n[fs_object_backend]\nname = s3\n......\nuse_https = true\n\n[block_backend]\nname = s3\n......\nuse_https = true\n\n\n\n\nBecause the server package is built on CentOS 6, if you're using Debian/Ubuntu, you have to copy the system CA bundle to CentOS's CA bundle path. Otherwise Seafile can't find the CA bundle so that the SSL connection will fail.\n\n\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/pki/tls/certs\nsudo cp /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt\nsudo ln -s /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt /etc/pki/tls/cert.pem\n\n\n\n\nAnother important note is that you \nmust not use '.' in your bucket names\n. Otherwise the wildcard certificate for AWS S3 cannot be resolved. This is a limitation on AWS.\n\n\nUse S3-compatible Object Storage\n\n\nMany object storage systems are now compatible with the S3 API, such as OpenStack Swift and Ceph's RADOS Gateway. You can use these S3-compatible storage systems as backend for Seafile. Here is an example config:\n\n\n[commit_object_backend]\nname = s3\nbucket = my-commit-objects\nkey_id = your-key-id\nkey = your-secret-key\nhost = 192.168.1.123:8080\npath_style_request = true\nmemcached_options = --SERVER=localhost --POOL-MIN=10 --POOL-MAX=100\n\n[fs_object_backend]\nname = s3\nbucket = my-fs-objects\nkey_id = your-key-id\nkey = your-secret-key\nhost = 192.168.1.123:8080\npath_style_request = true\nmemcached_options = --SERVER=localhost --POOL-MIN=10 --POOL-MAX=100\n\n[block_backend]\nname = s3\nbucket = my-block-objects\nkey_id = your-key-id\nkey = your-secret-key\nhost = 192.168.1.123:8080\npath_style_request = true\nmemcached_options = --SERVER=localhost --POOL-MIN=10 --POOL-MAX=100\n\n\n\n\nhost\n is the address and port of the S3-compatible service. You cannot prepend \"http\" or \"https\" to the \nhost\n option. By default it'll use http connections. If you want to use https connection, please set \nuse_https = true\n option.\n\n\npath_style_request\n asks Seafile to use URLs like \nhttps://192.168.1.123:8080/bucketname/object\n to access objects. In Amazon S3, the default URL format is in virtual host style, such as \nhttps://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/object\n. But this style relies on advanced DNS server setup. So most S3-compatible storage systems only implement the path style format.\n\n\nRun and Test\n\n\nNow you can start Seafile by \n./seafile.sh start\n and \n./seahub.sh start\n and visit the website.",

So HA is achieved.\n\n\nBackend storage: Distributed storage cluster, such as S3, Openstack Swift, Ceph.\n\n\n\n\nThis architecture scales horizontally. That is, you can handle more traffic by adding more machines. The architecture is presented in the following picture.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main components on the Seafile server node: web server (Nginx/Apache) and Seafile app server. The web server passes requests from the clients to Seafile app server. The Seafile app servers work independently. They don't know about each other's state. That means each app server can fail independently without affecting other app server instances. The load balancer is responsible for detecting failure and re-routing requests.\n\n\nEven though Seafile app servers work independently, they still have to share some session information. All shared session information are stored in memcached. So all Seafile app servers have to connect to the same memcached (cluster). More details about memcached configuration will discussed later.\n\n\nAll Seafile app servers access the same set of user data. The user data has two parts: in MySQL database and in backend storage cluster (S3, Ceph etc.). All app servers serve the data equally to the clients.\n\n\nFor database, all app servers have to connect to the same database or database cluster. We recommend to use MariaDB Galera Cluster if you need a database cluster.\n\n\nThere are a few steps to deploy a Seafile cluster:\n\n\n\n\nPrepare hardware, operating systems, memcached and database\n\n\nSetup a single Seafile server node\n\n\nCopy the deployment to other Seafile nodes\n\n\nSetup Nginx/Apache and firewall rules\n\n\nSetup load balancer\n\n\nSetup backgroup task node\n\n\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\nHardware\n\n\nAt least 2 Linux server with at least 2GB RAM.\n\n\nInstall Python libraries\n\n\nOn each mode, you need to install some python libraries.\n\n\nFirst make sure your have installed python 2.6 or 2.7, then:\n\n\nsudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install boto\n\n\n\n\nIf you receive an error about \"Wheel installs require setuptools \n= ...\", run this between the pip and boto lines above\n\n\nsudo pip install setuptools --no-use-wheel --upgrade\n\n\n\n\nSetup Memcached\n\n\nAll seafile server instances will share the same memcached servers. Let's assume that the address of memcached server is 192.168.1.134, listening on port 11211 (the default).\n\n\nBy default, memcached only listen on 127.0.0.1. So you should modify memcached.conf and restart memcached.\n\n\n# Specify which IP address to listen on. The default is to listen on all IP addresses\n# This parameter is one of the only security measures that memcached has, so make sure\n# it's listening on a firewalled interface.\n-l 0.0.0.0\n\n\n\n\nIt's also recommended to set a higher limit for memcached's memory, such as 256MB.\n\n\n# Start with a cap of 64 megs of memory. It's reasonable, and the daemon default\n# Note that the daemon will grow to this size, but does not start out holding this much\n# memory\n-m 256\n\n\n\n\nSeafile servers share session information within memcached. If you set up a memcached cluster, please make sure all the seafile server nodes connects to all the memcached nodes.\n\n\nWhen setting up a memcached cluster, you can either run one memcached instance on each Seafile server node, or set up separate machines for the memcached cluster. It usually saves you some money if you run memcached on Seafile server nodes.\n\n\n(Optional) Setup MariaDB Cluster\n\n\nMariaDB cluster helps you to remove single point of failure from the cluster architecture. Every update in the database cluster is synchronously replicated to all instances.\n\n\nIt's recommended that you run one database instance on each Seafile server node. There are a few benefits about this approach:\n\n\n\n\nThe Seafile app server always access its local database intance, which is faster.\n\n\nYou don't have to set up another load balancer for the database instances.\n\n\n\n\nThis architecture should scale well for a few tens of database nodes, since Seafile has no much write operations to the db. For bigger deployment, you'd better use more sophiscated load balancing techiques for the databases.\n\n\nDetails about setting up MariaDB cluster is covered in \nthis document\n.\n\n\n Configure a Single Node\n\n\nYou should make sure the config files on every Seafile server are consistent. \nIt's critical that you don't set up seafile server on each machine separately. You should set up seafile server on one machine then copy the config directory to the other machines.\n\n\nGet the license\n\n\nPut the license you get under the top level diretory. In our wiki, we use the diretory \n/data/haiwen/\n as the top level directory.\n\n\nDownload/Uncompress Seafile Professional Server\n\n\ntar xf seafile-pro-server_2.1.3_x86-64.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\nNow you have:\n\n\nhaiwen\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 seafile-license.txt\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 seafile-pro-server-2.1.3/\n\n\n\n\nSetup Seafile Config\n\n\nThe setup process of Seafile Professional Server is the same as the Seafile Community Server. See \nDownload and Setup Seafile Server With MySQL\n in the community wiki.\n\n\nNote: \nUse the load balancer's address or domain name for the server address. Don't use the local IP address of each Seafile server machine. This assures the user will always access your service via the load balancers.\n\n\nAfter the setup process is done, you still have to do a few manually changes to the config files.\n\n\nseafile.conf\n\n\nYou have to add the following configuration to \nseafile.conf\n\n\n[cluster]\nenabled = true\nmemcached_options = --SERVER=192.168.1.134 --POOL-MIN=10 --POOL-MAX=100\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a memcached cluster, you need to specify all the memcached server addresses in seafile.conf. The format is\n\n\n[cluster]\nenabled = true\nmemcached_options = --SERVER=192.168.1.134 --SERVER=192.168.1.135 --SERVER=192.168.1.136 --POOL-MIN=10 --POOL-MAX=100\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) The Seafile server also opens a port for the load balancers to run health checks. Seafile by default use port 11001. You can change this by adding the following config to \nseafile.conf\n\n\n[cluster]\nhealth_check_port = 12345\n\n\n\n\nseahub_settings.py\n\n\nInstall python memcache library.\n\n\nOn Debian/Ubuntu:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install python-memcache\n\n\n\n\nOn CentOS/RedHat:\n\n\nsudo yum install python-memcached\n\n\n\n\nAdd following configuration to \nseahub_settings.py\n. These settings tell Seahub to store avatar in database and cache avatar in memcached, and store css CACHE to local memory of every node.\n\n\nCACHES = {\n    'default': {\n        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache',\n        'LOCATION': '192.168.1.134:11211',\n    }\n}\n\nAVATAR_FILE_STORAGE = 'seahub.base.database_storage.DatabaseStorage'\n\nCOMPRESS_CACHE_BACKEND = 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache'\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use memcached cluster, please replace the \nCACHES\n variable with the following:\n\n\nCACHES = {\n    'default': {\n        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache',\n        'LOCATION': ['192.168.1.134:11211', '192.168.1.135:11211', '192.168.1.136:11211',],\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you enable thumbnail feature, you'd better set thumbnail storage path to a \nShared Folder\n, so that every node will create/get thumbnail through the same \nShared Folder\n.\n\n\nTHUMBNAIL_ROOT = 'path/to/shared/folder/'\n\n\n\n\nseafevents.conf\n\n\nAdd following to \nseafevents.conf\n to disable file indexing service on the local server. The file indexing service should be started on a dedicated background server.\n\n\n[INDEX FILES]\nexternal_es_server = true\n\n\n\n\nUpdate Seahub Database\n\n\nIn cluster environment, we have to store avatars in the database instead of in a local disk.\n\n\nCREATE TABLE `avatar_uploaded` (`filename` TEXT NOT NULL, `filename_md5` CHAR(32) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, `data` MEDIUMTEXT NOT NULL, `size` INTEGER NOT NULL, `mtime` datetime NOT NULL);\n\n\n\n\nBackend Storage Settings\n\n\nYou also need to add the settings for backend cloud storage systems to the config files.\n\n\n\n\nFor NFS: \nSetup Seafile cluster with NFS\n\n\nFor S3: \nSetup With Amazon S3\n\n\nFor OpenStack Swift: \nSetup With OpenStackSwift\n\n\nFor Ceph: \nSetup With Ceph\n\n\n\n\nRun and Test the Single Node\n\n\nOnce you have finished configuring this single node, start it to test if it can run correctly:\n\n\ncd /data/haiwen/seafile-server-latest\n./seafile.sh start\n./seahub.sh start\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n The first time you start seahub, the script would prompt you to create an admin account for your seafile server. \n\n\nOpen your browser and visit http://ip-address-of-this-node:8000, login with the admin account.\n\n\n Configure other nodes\n\n\nNow you have one node working fine, let's continue to configure other nodes.\n\n\nCopy the config to all Seafile servers\n\n\nSupposed your seafile installation directory is \n/data/haiwen\n, compress this whole directory into a tar ball and copy the tar ball to all other Seafile server machines. You can simply uncompress the tar ball and use it.\n\n\nOn each node, run \n./seafile.sh\n and \n./seahub.sh\n to start seafile server.\n\n\nSetup Nginx/Apache and Https\n\n\nYou'll usually want to use Nginx/Apache and https for web access. You need to set it up on each machine running Seafile server. \nMake sure the certificate on all the servers are the same.\n\n\n\n\nFor Nginx:\n\n\nConfig Seahub with Nginx\n\n\nEnabling Https with Nginx\n\n\nFor Apache:\n\n\nConfig Seahub with Apache\n\n\nEnabling Https with Apache\n\n\n\n\nFirewall Settings\n\n\nBeside \nstandard ports of a seafile server\n, there are 2 firewall rule changes for Seafile cluster:\n\n\n\n\nOn each Seafile server machine, you should open the health check port (default 11001);\n\n\nOn the memcached server, you should open the port 11211. For security, only the Seafile servers should be allow to access this port.\n\n\n\n\nLoad Balancer Setting\n\n\nNow that your cluster is already running, fire up the load balancer and welcome your users.\n\n\nAWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)\n\n\nIn the AWS ELB management console, after you've added the Seafile server instances to the instance list, you should do two more configurations.\n\n\nFirst you should setup TCP listeners\n\n\n\n\nThen you setup health check\n\n\n\n\nHAProxy\n\n\nThis is a sample \n/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg\n:\n\n\n(Assume your health check port is \n11001\n)\n\n\nglobal\n    log 127.0.0.1 local1 notice\n    maxconn 4096\n    user haproxy\n    group haproxy\n\ndefaults\n    log global\n    mode http\n    retries 3\n    maxconn 2000\n    timeout connect 10000\n    timeout client 300000\n    timeout server 300000\n\nlisten seahub 0.0.0.0:80\n    mode http\n    option httplog\n    option dontlognull\n    option forwardfor\n    server seahubserver01 192.168.1.165:80 check port 11001\n    server seahubserver02 192.168.1.200:80 check port 11001\n\nlisten seahub-https 0.0.0.0:443\n    mode tcp\n    option tcplog\n    option dontlognull\n    server seahubserver01 192.168.1.165:443 check port 11001\n    server seahubserver02 192.168.1.200:443 check port 11001\n\n\n\n\nSee how it runs\n\n\nNow you should be able to test your cluster. Open https://seafile.example.com in your browser and enjoy. You can also sync file with Seafile clients.\n\n\nIf the above works, the next step would be \nEnable search and background tasks in a cluster\n.",

The document is not a finished one. We will improve it continuously as our knowledge grow with several on going projects.\n\n\nBackgrounds\n\n\nSeafile organizes files into libraries. Each library is a GIT repository like file system tree with each file and folder identified by a unique hash value. These unique IDs are used in the syncing algorithm and there is no need to storing syncing state for each file in the database. Tranditional database like MySQL are not scalable to tens of millions of records, while object storages like Ceph and Swift are highly scalable. So in theory, Seafile is capable to storing billions of files for syncing and sharing.\n\n\nWhile files are saved into object storage, other information like sharing and permission has to be stored in database. MariaDB Galera can be used to provide a scalable and reliable database storage.\n\n\nHardware and system requirement\n\n\nIn the minimum, we use three machines to setup the cluster. Each machine should be of\n\n\n\n\n4 cores with 8GB or more memory.\n\n\n1 SSD disk to storing Ceph journal.\n\n\n1 SATA disk to storing the operating system\n\n\n1 SATA disk to storing MariaDB database\n\n\n4 or more SATA disk to store Ceph data\n\n\n\n\nWe use Ubuntu 14.04 server as the operating system. In the following, we denote the three server as node1, node2 and node3.\n\n\nSetup Ceph cluster\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\nChoose one node (say, node1) as admin node for installation. Install ceph-deploy on it.\n\n\n\n\nAdd the release key:  \n\n\n\n\nwget -q -O- 'https://ceph.com/git/?p=ceph.git;a=blob_plain;f=keys/release.asc' | sudo apt-key add -\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the Ceph packages to your repository. Replace {ceph-stable-release} with a stable Ceph release (e.g., emperor, firefly, giant etc.). The latest stable release is 'giant'.\n\n\n\n\necho deb http://ceph.com/debian-{ceph-stable-release}/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate your repository and install ceph-deploy:  \n\n\n\n\nsudo apt-get update \n sudo apt-get install ceph-deploy\n\n\n\n\nInstall ntp on all nodes, and restart ntp  \n\n\nsudo apt-get install ntp\nsudo service ntp restart\n\n\n\nInstall openssh on all nodes\n\n\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\n\n\nWe'll use a non-root user for installation. Make sure this user has password-less sudo privileges.\n\n\necho \"{username} ALL = (root) NOPASSWD:ALL\" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/{username}\nsudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/{username}\n\n\n\nGenerate ssh public key for the installation user on node1. Then copy that public key to other nodes \n~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n.\n\n\nCreate Ceph Cluster\n\n\nCreate a \nceph-cluster\n directory on node1 for storing the generated config files. All commands should be run under this directory.\n\n\nInstall Ceph on all nodes\n\n\nceph-deploy install node1 node2 node3\n\n\n\nCreate the cluster  \n\n\nceph-deploy new node1 node2 node3\n\n\n\nCreate Ceph monitors. You should open port 6789 on all nodes.\n\n\nceph-deploy mon create node1 node2 node3\n\n\n\nGather keys\n\n\nceph-deploy gatherkeys node1\n\n\n\nAdd OSDs\n\n\nIn Ceph, every OSD daemon manages one disk. The OSDs can share one SSD disk for journal.\nSuppose the SSD disk for journal is \n/dev/sdb\n and the SATA disks are \n/dev/sdc\n, \n/dev/sdd\n, etc. Add OSDs by the following commands:\n\n\nceph-deploy osd create node1:/dev/sdc:/dev/sdb\nceph-deploy osd create node2:/dev/sdc:/dev/sdb\nceph-deploy osd create node3:/dev/sdc:/dev/sdb\nceph-deploy osd create node1:/dev/sdd:/dev/sdb\nceph-deploy osd create node2:/dev/sdd:/dev/sdb\nceph-deploy osd create node3:/dev/sdd:/dev/sdb\n\n\n\nnote\n By default Ceph uses a journal partition of size 5GB. The creation of OSD will fail if your journal disk is too small. You can add the following config to /etc/ceph/ceph.conf:\n\n\n[osd]\n    # set journal size to 4GB\n        osd journal size = 4000\n\n\n\n\nCheck Cluster Status\n\n\nCeph cluster setup is done. You can check cluster status by \nsudo ceph -s\n.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nhttp://ceph.com/docs/master/rados/deployment/\n\n\nSetup MariaDB cluster\n\n\nInstall MariaDB and Galera\n\n\nFirst, set apt source for MariaDB and Galera. Choose a repository for 5.5 in \nthis page\n.\nThen you can install mariadb and galera.\n\n\nsudo apt-get install mariadb-galera-server galera\nsudo apt-get install rsync\n\n\n\nConfig MariaDB\n\n\nIn \n/etc/mysql/conf.d/cluster.cnf\n\n\n[mysqld]\n\nquery_cache_size=0\nbinlog_format=ROW\ndefault-storage-engine=innodb\ninnodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2\nquery_cache_type=0\nbind-address=0.0.0.0\n\n# Galera Provider Configuration\nwsrep_provider=/usr/lib/galera/libgalera_smm.so\n#wsrep_provider_options=\"gcache.size=32G\"\n\n# Galera Cluster Configuration\nwsrep_cluster_name=\"test_cluster\"\nwsrep_cluster_address=\"gcomm://first_ip,second_ip,third_ip\n\n# Galera Synchronization Congifuration\nwsrep_sst_method=rsync\n#wsrep_sst_auth=user:pass\n\n# Galera Node Configuration\nwsrep_node_address=\"this_node_ip\"\nwsrep_node_name=\"this_node_name\"\n\n\n\nHere first_ip, second_ip and third_ip are corresponding to the IP address of node1, node2 and node3.\n\n\nChange the data directory for MariaDB\n\n\nWe want to store the database data in a separate disk. Supposed the disk is mounted to the path \n/mysql\n.\n\n\nStop MariaDB using the following command:\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop\n\n\n\nCopy the existing data directory (default located in /var/lib/mysql) using the following command:\n\n\nsudo cp -R -p /var/lib/mysql/* /mysql\n\n\n\nEdit /etc/mysql/my.cnf, update \ndatadir\n option to \n/mysql\n.\n\n\nRestart MariaDB with the command:\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart\n\n\n\nStart\n\n\nBefore staring the MariaDB cluster, make sure port 3456 and 4444 are open on all database nodes.\n\n\nIn node1:\n\n\nnode1# sudo service mysql start --wsrep-new-cluster\n\n\n\nIn node2 and node3:\n\n\nnode2# sudo service mysql start\nnode3# sudo service mysql start\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-a-galera-cluster-with-mariadb-on-ubuntu-12-04-servers\n\n\nSetup Seafile cluster\n\n\nPlease follow http://manual.seafile.com/deploy_pro/setup_with_ceph.html to set seafile with Ceph and follow http://manual.seafile.com/deploy_pro/deploy_in_a_cluster.html for setup Seafile cluster.",

            "text": "Seafile Real-Time Backup Server\n\n\nNOTE: The real-time backup feature is currently in beta state. It may have minor issues on the backup server side. But this feature will not affect the functionality or data integrity of the primary server.\n\n\nBackup is the procedure that copies data from a primary server (which is running production service) to a backup server.\n\n\nBackup is an important procedure to keep data safe. The basic backup procedure described in \nthis documentation\n has a few drawbacks:\n\n\n\n\nThe backup is done in fixed \"backup windows\" (once per day or a few times per day). The latest data written between two backup windows will be lost if the primary server storage is damaged.\n\n\nThe backup procedure backup database and data directory separately. In the backup server, some entries in the database may become inconsistent with the data directory. This causes some libraries become \"corrupted\" after restore.\n\n\n\n\nThe real-time backup server uses a syncing algorithm similar to the Seafile desktop client to retrieve data from the primary server. It works as follows:\n\n\n\n\nWhenever a library is updated, the primary server notifies the backup server to retrieve the changed data. With a delta syncing algorithm, this procedure runs quickly and updates the backup server in nearly real-time.\n\n\nThe backup server also checks all libraries on the primary server at a fixed period. Any new or updated libraries will be synced to the backup server. This will pick up any legged updates due to glitches in the above real-time sync procedure.\n\n\nThe backup server always keep the database and data directory consistent. So no libraries on the backup server will be in corrupted state (unless they're already corrupted on the primary server).\n\n\nThe full history of all libraries will be backed up. This is not like the desktop client, which only syncs the latest state of a library.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two sets of data that need to be backup:\n\n\n\n\nThe seafile-data directory and the core library metadata tables in the seafile database. This data is the core data structures of the libraries in Seafile. They're synced to the backup server with Seafile's syncing algorithm. In this procedure, the metadata tables are kept consistent with the seafile-data directory.\n\n\nAll other tables in the database (including seafile, ccnet and seahub databases) are backup with MySQL replication.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Real-Time Backup Server\n\n\nWe assume you already have a primary server running, and now you want to setup a backup server.\n\n\nThe steps to setup the backup server are:\n\n\n\n\nInstall Seafile on the backup server\n\n\nConfigure MySQL replication between the primary server and the backup server\n\n\nConfigure Seafile syncing between the primary server and the backup server\n\n\n\n\nInstall Seafile on the Backup Server\n\n\nYou should install Seafile Pro Edition on the backup server according to \nthis documentation\n. Since the real-time backup feature is only available for 5.1.0 or later, you also have to upgrade your primary server to 5.1.0 version or later.\n\n\nWhen installing Seafile on the backup server, you have to notice:\n\n\n\n\nThe database names (ccnet, seafile and seahub database) should be the same as the names on the primary server.\n\n\nYou don't need to enable other Pro features, such as Office file preview, search indexing, file auditing etc.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure MySQL Replication\n\n\nMySQL replication asynchronously replicates database updates from a Master server (in our case, the primary server) to a Slave server (the backup server). To better understand how MySQL replication works and how to configure it, you should first read \nMySQL official documentation\n. The following steps are based on the steps in MySQL documentation, with some modifications for Seafile.\n\n\nIn the following discussion, we'll use \"primary server\" and \"master server\", \"backup server\" and \"slave server\" interchangeably.\n\n\nModify MySQL Server Configuration on Primary Server (my.cnf)\n\n\nOn the primary server, add following options to my.cnf:\n\n\n[mysqld]\nlog-bin=mysql-bin\nserver-id=1\n\n\n\n\nIn the my.cnf of the primary server, another important option is \nexpire_logs_days\n (\nreference\n). This option controls the retention time of the binary log, which is used for replication. The default value of this option is to keep binary log files forever. You can set this option to keep the binary log files for specific days. Binary log files older than the specified days will be deleted. So if the backup server is offline for more than \nexpire_logs_days\n, the replication cannot be resumed after the backup server is online. We recommend to set this option to a long enough time.\n\n\nAfter saving the changes, you should restart MySQL on primary server.\n\n\nCreate a User for Replication in MySQL\n\n\nOn the primary server, create a user dedicated for replication. In MySQL client prompt,\n\n\nCREATE USER 'repl'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'slavepass';\nGRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl'@'%';\n\n\n\n\nReplace the user name and password with your own choice.\n\n\nObtain the Replication Master Binary Log Coordinates\n\n\nBefore running this step, you should stop Seafile service on the primary server, so that no update will be written into database.\n\n\nOn the primary (Master) server, in MySQL client prompt,\n\n\nFLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;\nSHOW MASTER STATUS;\n\n\n\n\nYou'll get output similar to the following:\n\n\n+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+-------------------+\n| File             | Position | Binlog_Do_DB | Binlog_Ignore_DB | Executed_Gtid_Set |\n+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+-------------------+\n| mysql-bin.000002 |   368915 |              |                  |                   |\n+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+-------------------+\n\n\n\n\nThe \nFile\n and \nPosition\n fields in output will be used to configure the backup server (replication Slave).\n\n\nExport Existing Data on the Primary Server\n\n\nExporting data from the databases on the primary server with mysqldump:\n\n\nmysqldump -u \nuser\n -p\npassword\n --databases \\\n--ignore-table=\nseafile_db\n.Repo --ignore-table=\nseafile_db\n.Branch --ignore-table=\nseafile_db\n.RepoHead \\\n--ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.base_userlastlogin --ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.django_session \\\n--ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.sysadmin_extra_userloginlog --ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.UserTrafficStat \\\n--ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.FileAudit --ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.FileUpdate --ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.PermAudit \\\n--ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.Event --ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.UserEvent --ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.avatar_avatar \\\n--ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.avatar_groupavatar --ignore-table=\nseahub_db\n.avatar_uploaded \\\n--master-data \nseafile_db\n \nccnet_db\n \nseahub_db\n \n dbdump.sql\n\n\n\n\nYou should replace \nuser\n, \npassword\n with your MySQL admin user and password. You should replace \nseafile_db\n, \nseahub_db\n and \nccnet_db\n with your database names.\n\n\nModify MySQL Server Configuration on Backup Server (my.cnf)\n\n\nOn the backup server, add following options to my.cnf:\n\n\n[mysqld]\nserver-id=2\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseafile db\n.Repo\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseafile db\n.Branch\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseafile db\n.RepoHead\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.base_userlastlogin\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.django_session\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.sysadmin_extra_userloginlog\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.UserTrafficStat\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.FileAudit\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.FileUpdate\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.PermAudit\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.avatar_avatar\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.avatar_groupavatar\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.avatar_uploaded\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.Event\nreplicate-ignore-table = \nseahub db\n.UserEvent\n\n\n\n\nThe above configuration tells the backup server to ignore following tables on replication:\n\n\n\n\nThe library metadata tables in Seafile db\uff1aRepo, Branch, RepoHead\u3002These tables will be synced by Seafile backup server itself.\n\n\nLocal or temporary tables in Seahub database. When the admin logs into the backup server to view the data, these tables may be updated on the backup server. To avoid conflicts with the replicated entries, we ignore them on replication.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nserver-id\n for the primary and backup server must be different.\n\n\nYou should replace \nseafile db\n and \nseahub db\n with your database names.\n\n\n\n\nRestart MySQL server on backup server, with \n--skip-slave-start\n option so that replication does not start.\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql start --skip-slave-start\n\n\n\n\nImport Existing Data into backup server\n\n\nImporting existing data into the backup server's MySQL:\n\n\nmysql -u \nusr\n -p\npas\n \n dbdump.sql\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nuser\n and \npass\n with your MySQL admin user name and password.\n\n\nStart Replication\n\n\nUnlock MySQL on the primary server. In MySQL client prompt,\n\n\nunlock tables;\n\n\n\n\nOn the backup server, setup replication start coordinates:\n\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='primary-host', MASTER_USER='user', MASTER_PASSWORD='slavepass', MASTER_LOG_FILE='bin-log-file', MASTER_LOG_POS=position;\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nprimary-host\n with the MySQL master server address; Replace \nuser\n with the dedicated user for replication; Replace \nslavepass\n with the dedicated user's password; Replace \nbin-log-file\n and \nposition\n with the information you obtained in the \"Obtain the Replication Master Binary Log Coordinates\" section.\n\n\nStart replication on the backup server. In MySQL client prompt,\n\n\nstart slave;\n\n\n\n\nAfter staring replication, you should see some log messages in MySQL's error.log on the backup server, stating the replication is started. And the slave will catch up with any new updates on the master server.\n\n\nConfigure Real-time Backup in Seafile\n\n\nOn the primary server, add following options to seafile.conf:\n\n\n[backup]\nbackup_url = http://backup-server\nsync_token = c7a78c0210c2470e14a20a8244562ab8ad509734\n\n\n\n\nOn the backup server, add following options to seafile.conf:\n\n\n[backup]\nprimary_url = http://primary-server\nsync_token = c7a78c0210c2470e14a20a8244562ab8ad509734\nsync_poll_interval = 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbackup_url\n: the backup server's address in url format. You can use http or https.\n\n\nprimary_url\n: the primary server's address in url format.\n\n\nsync_token\n: a secret that shared between the primary and backup server. It's 40 character SHA1 generated by the system admin. You can use \nuuidgen | openssl sha1\n command to generate a random token.\n\n\nsync_poll_interval\n: The backup server polls all libraries of the primary server periodically. You can set the poll interval in the unit of hours. The default interval is 1 hour, which mean the backup server will poll the primary every hour. You should choose larger intervals if you have large number of libraries.\n\n\n\n\nAfter saving the configuration, restart seafile service on the primary and backup servers. The backup server will automatically start backup on restart.\n\n\nSetup Backup Server for Seafile Cluster\n\n\nIf your primary service runs as a Seafile cluster, you have two points to notice when setting up a backup server:\n\n\n\n\nYou should only use one MySQL instance as the replication master, if you're using MariaDB cluster.\n\n\nYou have to change seafile.conf and set the \nbackup_url\n and \nsync_token\n options on each Seafile node. The configuration on all primary Seafile node should be the same. They all point to the same backup server.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently you cannot deploy the backup service \nas\n a cluster. That is, you can only use a single node as backup server. This support may be added in the future.\n\n\nManaging the Real-time Backup Server\n\n\nOnce set up, the backup server is a fully working Seafile instance. The admin can manage the backup server in two ways:\n\n\n\n\nAccess the server via Seahub web interface, just like a normal Seafile instance.\n\n\nUse the \nseaf-backup-cmd.sh\n script in the server package to manage the backup function.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nseaf-backup-cmd.sh\n script provides the following commands:\n\n\nChecking Backup Status\n\n\nseaf-backup-cmd.sh\n provides \nstatus\n command to view the backup status. The output is like:\n\n\n# ./seaf-backup-cmd.sh status\nTotal number of libraries: xxx\nNumber of synchronized libraries: xxx\nNumber of libraries waiting for sync: xxx\nNumber of libraries syncing: xxx\nNumber of libraries failed to sync: xxx\n\nList of syncing libraries:\nxxx\nxxx\n\nList of libraries failed to sync:\nxxx\nxxx\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few reasons that may fail the backup of a library:\n\n\n\n\nSome data in the primary server is corrupted. The data may be in the latest state or in history. Since the backup procedure syncs the full history, corruption in history will fail the backup.\n\n\nThe primary server has run seaf-fsck, which may restore a library back to an older state.\n\n\n\n\nManually Trigger Syncing a Library\n\n\nYou can use the \nsync\n command to manually schedule backup of a library:\n\n\n# ./seaf-backup-cmd.sh sync \nlibrary id\n\n\n\n\n\nThe command will block until the backup is finished.\n\n\nHandling Backup Errors\n\n\nThe \n--force\n option of \nsync\n command can be used to force failing backup to complete. Permanent backup failures are usually caused by data corruption of a library in the primary server. The \n--force\n option asks the backup to skip corrupted objects and finish the backup.\n\n\nWhen you find a backup error, follow two steps:\n\n\n\n\nRun seaf-fsck on the primary server, for the failing libraries. Fsck fixes any corruption for the latest state of the libraries.\n\n\nRun \nseaf-backup-cmd.sh sync --force \nlibrary id\n on the backup server.\n\n\n\n\nRestore from the Backup Server\n\n\nSince the backup server is a fully workable Seafile instance, you can switch your service to the backup server after your primary is severely damaged. But you need to take a few points into consideration before switching to the backup server.\n\n\n\n\nYou should first try to repair the primary server as long as possible. Running seaf-fsck will fix most daily corruptions on the primary server.\n\n\nEven with the near real-time feature of the backup server, the data on the backup server may still be a bit older than the primary server. This is especially true for the libraries failed to backup.\n\n\n\n\nBefore switching to the backup server, you should first unsync all clients which is syncing with \"failed to backup\" libraries.\n\n\nSupposed the output of \nseaf-backup-cmd.sh status\n is as follows:\n\n\nList of libraries failed to sync:\nf690ea2c-fe4d-459a-ba1e-165cdc6df391\ne2df70b5-cd80-496f-98cf-c9f038cf1307\n\n\n\n\nYou run the following command within MySQL on the backup server:\n\n\nuse seafile-db;\ndelete from RepoUserToken where repo_id in ('f690ea2c-fe4d-459a-ba1e-165cdc6df391', 'e2df70b5-cd80-496f-98cf-c9f038cf1307');",

            "text": "NOTE: The real-time backup feature is currently in beta state. It may have minor issues on the backup server side. But this feature will not affect the functionality or data integrity of the primary server.  Backup is the procedure that copies data from a primary server (which is running production service) to a backup server.  Backup is an important procedure to keep data safe. The basic backup procedure described in  this documentation  has a few drawbacks:   The backup is done in fixed \"backup windows\" (once per day or a few times per day). The latest data written between two backup windows will be lost if the primary server storage is damaged.  The backup procedure backup database and data directory separately. In the backup server, some entries in the database may become inconsistent with the data directory. This causes some libraries become \"corrupted\" after restore.   The real-time backup server uses a syncing algorithm similar to the Seafile desktop client to retrieve data from the primary server. It works as follows:   Whenever a library is updated, the primary server notifies the backup server to retrieve the changed data. With a delta syncing algorithm, this procedure runs quickly and updates the backup server in nearly real-time.  The backup server also checks all libraries on the primary server at a fixed period. Any new or updated libraries will be synced to the backup server. This will pick up any legged updates due to glitches in the above real-time sync procedure.  The backup server always keep the database and data directory consistent. So no libraries on the backup server will be in corrupted state (unless they're already corrupted on the primary server).  The full history of all libraries will be backed up. This is not like the desktop client, which only syncs the latest state of a library.   There are two sets of data that need to be backup:   The seafile-data directory and the core library metadata tables in the seafile database. This data is the core data structures of the libraries in Seafile. They're synced to the backup server with Seafile's syncing algorithm. In this procedure, the metadata tables are kept consistent with the seafile-data directory.  All other tables in the database (including seafile, ccnet and seahub databases) are backup with MySQL replication.",

            "text": "FAQ\n\n\nFAQ about Search\n\n\n\n\nQ: However I tried, files in an encrypted library aren't listed in the search results\n\n\n\n\nA: This is because the server can't index encrypted files, since, they are encrypted.\n\n\n\n\nQ: I switched to Professional Server from Community Server, but whatever I search, I get no results\n\n\n\n\nA: The search index is updated every 10 minutes by default. So before the first index update is performed, you get nothing no matter what you search.\n\n\nTo be able to search immediately,\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you have started seafile server\n\n\nUpdate the search index manually:\n  \ncd haiwen/seafile-pro-server-1.7.0\n  ./pro/pro.py search --update\n\n\n\n\nIf you have lots of files, this process may take quite a while.\n\n\n\n\nQ: I want to enable full text search for office/pdf documents, so I set \nindex_office_pdf\n to \ntrue\n in the configuration file, but it doesn't work.\n\n\n\n\nA: In this case, you need to:\n  1. Edit the value of \nindex_office_pdf\n option in \nseafevents.conf\n to \ntrue\n\n  2. Restart seafile server\n  \ncd /data/haiwen/seafile-pro-server-1.7.0/\n  ./seafile.sh restart\n\n  3. Delete the existing search index\n  \n./pro/pro.py search --clear\n\n  4. Create and update the search index again\n  \n./pro/pro.py search --update\n\n\nFAQ about libreoffice-based office documents preview\n\n\n\n\nQ: The browser displays \"document conversion failed\", and in the logs I see messages like \n[WARNING] failed to convert xxx to ...\n, what should I do?\n\n\n\n\nA: Sometimes the libreoffice process need to be restarted, especially if it's the first time seafile server is running on the server.\n\n\nTry to kill the libreoffice process:\n  \nsh\n  pkill -f soffice.bin\n\n  Now try re-opening the preview page in the brower again.\n\n\nAlso if you are deploying seafile in cluster mode, make sure memcached is working on each server.\n\n\n\n\nQ: The above solution does not solve my problem.\n\n\n\n\nA: Please check whether the user you run Seafile can correctly start the libreoffice process. There may be permission problems. For example, if you use www-data user to run Seafile, make sure www-data has a home directory and can write to the home directory.",

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nThere are generally two parts of data to backup\n\n\n\n\nSeafile library data\n\n\nDatabases\n\n\n\n\nIf you setup seafile server according to our manual, you should have a directory layout like:\n\n\nhaiwen       # Replace the name with your organization name\n  --seafile-server-2.x.x # untar from seafile package\n  --seafile-data   # seafile configuration and data (if you choose the default)\n  --seahub-data    # seahub data\n  --ccnet          # ccnet configuration and data \n  --seahub.db      # sqlite3 database used by seahub\n  --seahub_settings.py # optional config file for seahub\n\n\n\nAll your library data is stored under the 'haiwen' directory.\n\n\nSeafile also stores some important metadata data in a few databases. The names and locations of these databases depends on which database software you use.\n\n\nFor SQLite, the database files are also under the 'haiwen' directory. The locations are:\n\n\n\n\nccnet/PeerMgr/usermgr.db: contains user information\n\n\nccnet/GroupMgr/groupmgr.db: contains group information\n\n\nseafile-data/seafile.db: contains library metadata\n\n\nseahub.db: contains tables used by the web front end (seahub)\n\n\n\n\nFor MySQL, the databases are created by the administrator, so the names can be different from one deployment to another. There are 3 databases:\n\n\n\n\nccnet-db: contains user and group information\n\n\nseafile-db: contains library metadata\n\n\nseahub.db: contains tables used by the web front end (seahub)\n\n\n\n\nBackup steps\n\n\nThe backup is a three step procedure:\n\n\n\n\nOptional: Stop Seafile server first if you're using SQLite as database.\n\n\nBackup the databases;\n\n\nBackup the seafile data directory;\n\n\n\n\nBackup Order: Database First or Data Directory First\n\n\n\n\nbackup data directory first, SQL later: When you're backing up data directory, some new objects are written and they're not backed up. Those new objects may be referenced in SQL database. So when you restore, some records in the database cannot find its object. So the library is corrupted.\n\n\nbackup SQL first, data directory later: Since you backup database first, all records in the database have valid objects to be referenced. So the libraries won't be corrupted. But new objects written to storage when you're backing up are not referenced by database records. So some libraries are out of date. When you restore, some new data are lost.\n\n\n\n\nThe second sequence is better in the sense that it avoids library corruption. Like other backup solutions, some new data can be lost in recovery. There is always a backup window.\nHowever, if your storage backup mechanism can finish quickly enough, using the first sequence can retain more data.\n\n\nWe assume your seafile data directory is in \n/data/haiwen\n. And you want to backup to \n/backup\n directory. The \n/backup\n can be an NFS or Windows share mount exported by another machine, or just an external disk.

Don't overwrite older database backups for at least a week.\n\n\nMySQL\n\n\nAssume your database names are \nccnet-db\n, \nseafile-db\n and \nseahub-db\n. mysqldump automatically locks the tables so you don't need to stop Seafile server when backing up MySQL databases. Since the database tables are usually very small, it won't take long to dump.\n\n\nmysqldump -h [mysqlhost] -u[username] -p[password] --opt ccnet-db \n /backup/databases/ccnet-db.sql.`date +\"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S\"`\n\nmysqldump -h [mysqlhost] -u[username] -p[password] --opt seafile-db \n /backup/databases/seafile-db.sql.`date +\"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S\"`\n\nmysqldump -h [mysqlhost] -u[username] -p[password] --opt seahub-db \n /backup/databases/seahub-db.sql.`date +\"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S\"`\n\n\n\nSQLite\n\n\nYou need to stop Seafile server first before backing up SQLite database.\n\n\nsqlite3 /data/haiwen/ccnet/GroupMgr/groupmgr.db .dump \n /backup/databases/groupmgr.db.bak.`date +\"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S\"`\n\nsqlite3 /data/haiwen/ccnet/PeerMgr/usermgr.db .dump \n /backup/databases/usermgr.db.bak.`date +\"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S\"`\n\nsqlite3 /data/haiwen/seafile-data/seafile.db .dump \n /backup/databases/seafile.db.bak.`date +\"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S\"`\n\nsqlite3 /data/haiwen/seahub.db .dump \n /backup/databases/seahub.db.bak.`date +\"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S\"`\n\n\n\nBacking up Seafile library data\n\n\nThe data files are all stored in the \n/data/haiwen\n directory, so just back up the whole directory. You can directly copy the whole directory to the backup destination, or you can use rsync to do incremental backup. \n\n\nTo directly copy the whole data directory,\n\n\ncp -R /data/haiwen /backup/data/haiwen-`date +\"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S\"`\n\n\n\nThis produces a separate copy of the data directory each time. You can delete older backup copies after a new one is completed.\n\n\nIf you have a lot of data, copying the whole data directory would take long. You can use rsync to do incremental backup.\n\n\nrsync -az /data/haiwen /backup/data\n\n\n\nThis command backup the data directory to \n/backup/data/haiwen\n.\n\n\nRestore from backup\n\n\nNow supposed your primary seafile server is broken, you're switching to a new machine.

For SQLite, the database files are also under the 'haiwen' directory. The locations are:   ccnet/PeerMgr/usermgr.db: contains user information  ccnet/GroupMgr/groupmgr.db: contains group information  seafile-data/seafile.db: contains library metadata  seahub.db: contains tables used by the web front end (seahub)   For MySQL, the databases are created by the administrator, so the names can be different from one deployment to another.

This tool recovers any corrupted library back to its last consistent and usable state.\n\n\nStarting from version 4.1, we provide a seaf-fsck.sh script.

In such case, fsck will try to find the last consistent state and check the integrity in that state.\n\n\nTips: \nIf you have many libraries, it's helpful to save the fsck output into a log file for later analysis.\n\n\nRepairing Corruption\n\n\nCorruption repair in seaf-fsck basically works in two steps:\n\n\n\n\nIf the library state (commit) recorded in database is not found in data directory, find the last available state from data directory.\n\n\nCheck data integrity in that specific state. If files or directories are corrupted, set them to empty files or empty directories. The corrupted paths will be reported, so that the user can recover them from somewhere else.\n\n\n\n\nRunning the following command repairs all the libraries:\n\n\ncd seafile-server-latest\n./seaf-fsck.sh --repair\n\n\n\n\nMost of time you run the read-only integrity check first, to find out which libraries are corrupted. And then you repair specific libraries with the following command:\n\n\ncd seafile-server-latest\n./seaf-fsck.sh --repair [library-id1] [library-id2] ...\n\n\n\n\nBecause corrupted files and directories are emptied after repair, syncing the library after repair may result in data lost in the clients. The good copies on the clients may be replaced by the empty copies. To prevent this from happening, the system prevents a \"repaired\" library from syncing to clients. The system admin should inform the users to recover the corrupted files and folders. And then run the following command to enable syncing for the library again:\n\n\ncd seafile-server-latest\n./seaf-fsck.sh --enable-sync [library-id1] [library-id2] ...\n\n\n\n\nChange after CE 5.0.3 and Pro 5.0.2\n\n\nSince community eidition 5.0.3 and Pro edition 5.0.2, we improved seaf-fsck repair operation. Two improvements are added:\n\n\n\n\nAfter running \"--repair\" operation, the system admin doesn't need to run \"--enable-sync\" command any more. Instead, seaf-fsck automatically disconnects all syncing clients to the library. So the users are forced to re-sync the library.\n\n\nIn the library history, seaf-fsck includes the list of files and folders that are corrupted. So it's much easier to located corrupted paths.\n\n\n\n\nBest Practice for Repairing a Library\n\n\nTo check all libraries and find out which library is corrupted, the system admin can run seaf-fsck.sh without any argument and save the output to a log file. Search for keyword \"Fail\" in the log file to locate corrupted libraries.\n\n\nWhen the system admin find a library is corrupted, he/she should run seaf-fsck.sh with \"--repair\" for the library. After the command fixes the library, the admin should inform user to recover files from other places. There are two ways:\n\n\n\n\nUpload corrupted files or folders via the web interface\n\n\nIf the library was synced to some desktop computer, and that computer has a correct version of the corrupted file, resyncing the library on that computer will upload the corrupted files to the server.\n\n\n\n\nExporting Libraries to File System\n\n\nSince version 4.2.0, you can use seaf-fsck to export all the files in libraries to external file system (such as Ext4). This procedure doesn't rely on the seafile database. As long as you have your seafile-data directory, you can always export your files from Seafile to external file system.\n\n\nThe command syntax is\n\n\ncd seafile-server-latest\n./seaf-fsck.sh --export top_export_path [library-id1] [library-id2] ...\n\n\n\n\nThe argument \ntop_export_path\n is a directory to place the exported files. Each library will be exported as a sub-directory of the export path. If you don't specify library ids, all libraries will be exported.\n\n\nCurrently only un-encrypted libraries can be exported. Encrypted libraries will be skipped.",

And then you repair specific libraries with the following command:  cd seafile-server-latest\n./seaf-fsck.sh --repair [library-id1] [library-id2] ...  Because corrupted files and directories are emptied after repair, syncing the library after repair may result in data lost in the clients. The good copies on the clients may be replaced by the empty copies. To prevent this from happening, the system prevents a \"repaired\" library from syncing to clients. The system admin should inform the users to recover the corrupted files and folders. And then run the following command to enable syncing for the library again:  cd seafile-server-latest\n./seaf-fsck.sh --enable-sync [library-id1] [library-id2] ...",

Instead, seaf-fsck automatically disconnects all syncing clients to the library. So the users are forced to re-sync the library.

After the body is completely received, Nginx will send the body to the upstream server (SeafDAV in our case). But it seems when file size is very large, the buffering mechanism dosen't work well. It may stop proxying the body in the middle. So if you want to support file upload larger for 4GB, we suggest you install Nginx version \n= 1.8.0 and add \nproxy_request_buffering off\n to Nginx configuration.\n\n\n\uc608\uc81c \uc124\uc815 3: Apache\n\n\n\ub2e4\uc74c \uc124\uc815\uc740 Apache 2.4 \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud568\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\nWebDAV \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \nhttp://example.com/seafdav\n \uc8fc\uc18c\ub85c Seafile WebDAV \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n\n\n[WEBDAV]\nenabled = true\nport = 8080\nfastcgi = false\nshare_name = /seafdav\n\n\n\n\nIn the above config, the value of '''share_name''' is changed to '''/seafdav''', which is the address suffix you assign to SeafDAV server. \nNote that we do not use fastcgi for Apache.\n\n\nApache \uc124\uc815 \ud30c\uc77c(site-enabled/000-default)\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624:\n\n\nhttps\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 Apache\n\n\nApache \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \nSeafile\uacfc Apache\ub97c \uac00\ub3d9\n\ud560 \ub54c, \uad00\ub828 \uc124\uc815 \ud30c\uc77c\uc5d0 Seafdav\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ServerName www.myseafile.com\n    # Use \"DocumentRoot /var/www/html\" for Centos/Fedora\n    # Use \"DocumentRoot /var/www\" for Ubuntu/Debian\n    DocumentRoot /var/www\n    Alias /media  /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-latest/seahub/media\n\n    RewriteEngine On\n\n    \n\n        Require all granted\n    \n\n\n    #\n    # seafile fileserver\n    #\n    ProxyPass /seafhttp http://127.0.0.1:8082\n    ProxyPassReverse /seafhttp http://127.0.0.1:8082\n    RewriteRule ^/seafhttp -

After the body is completely received, Nginx will send the body to the upstream server (SeafDAV in our case). But it seems when file size is very large, the buffering mechanism dosen't work well. It may stop proxying the body in the middle.

            "text": "Security Questions\n\n\nHow is the connection between client and server encrypted?\n\n\nBefore version 4.0, Seafile only supports syncing via a self-designed protocol. Every seafile desktop client has a unique private key. When a client and a server connect, they will exchange public key and negotiate a session key. The session key is derived from cryptographically secure random number with PDKDF2 algorithm. And it's exchanged between the client and the server with RSA encryption. This session key will be used to encrypt the data transfer with AES-256/CBC algorithm. \n\n\nFrom version 4.0, Seafile supports syncing via HTTP(S) protocol, which is a more standard approach.\n\n\nFrom version 4.1, Seafile uses HTTP(S) syncing protocol by default.\n\n\nEncrypted Library\n\n\nSeafile provides a feature called encrypted library to protect your privacy. The file encryption/decryption is performed in the client-side when using the desktop client for file syncing. The password of an encrypted library is not stored in the server. \nEven the system admin of the server can't view the file contents - they can however view the metadata \nwhich are currently not encrypted\n.\n The metadata includes: the complete list of directory and file names, every file size, the history of who changed each file, when, and what byte ranges were altered.\n\n\nCAUTION: The client side encryption is not work currently for web browser and the cloud file browser of the desktop client. When you browsing encrypted libraries via the web browser and the cloud file browser, you will need to input the password. And the server will use the password to decrypt the \"file key\" for the library (see description below) and cache it in memory for 1 hour. The plain text password is never stored or cached on the server.\n\n\nUpdate: The client side encryption works on iOS client since version 2.1.6. The Android client doesn't support client side encryption yet. \n\n\nHow does an encrypted library work?\n\n\nWhen you create an encrypted library, you'll provide a password for it. All the data in that library will be encrypted with the password before uploading to the server.\n\n\nThe encryption procedure is:\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a 32-byte long cryptographically strong random number. This will be used as the file encryption key (\"file key\").\n\n\nEncrypt the file key with the user provided password. We first use PBKDF2 algorithm (1000 iteratioins of SHA256) to derive a key/iv pair from the password, then use AES 256/CBC to encrypt the file key. The result is called the \"encrypted file key\". This encrypted file key will be sent to and stored on the server. When you need to access the data, you can decrypt the file key from the encrypted file key.\n\n\nAll file data is encrypted by the file key with AES 256/CBC. We use PBKDF2 algorithm (1000 iterations of SHA256) to derive key/iv pair from the file key. After encryption, the data is uploaded to the server.\n\n\n\n\nThe above encryption procedure can be executed on the desktop and the mobile client. The Seahub browser client uses a different encryption procedure that happens at the server. Because of this your password will be transferred to the server.\n\n\nWhen you sync an encrypted library to the desktop, the client needs to verify your password. When you create the library, a \"magic token\" is derived from the password and library id. This token is stored with the library on the server side. The client use this token to check whether your password is correct before you sync the library. The magic token is generated by PBKDF2 algorithm with 1000 iterations of SHA256 hash.\n\n\nFor maximum security, the plain-text password won't be saved on the client side too. The client only saves the key/iv pair derived from the \"file key\", which is used to decrypt the data. So if you forget the password, you won't be able to recover it or access your data on the server.\n\n\nWhy fileserver delivers every content to everybody knowing the content URL of an unshared private file?\n\n\nWhen a file download link is clicked, a random URL is generated for user to access the file from fileserver. This url can only be access for once. After that, all access will be denied to the url. So even someone else happens to know about the url, he/she can't access it any more.\n\n\nHow does Seafile store user login password?\n\n\nUser login passwords are stored in hash form only. Note that user login password is different from the passwords used in encrypted libraries. In the database, it's format is\n\n\nPBKDF2SHA256$iterations$salt$hash\n\n\n\n\nThe record is divided into 4 parts by the $ sign.\n\n\n\n\nThe first part is the hash algorithm used. Currently we use PBKDF2 with SHA256. It can be changed to even stronger algorithm if needed.\n\n\nThe second part is the number of iterations of the hash algorithm\n\n\nThe third part is the random salt used for generating the hash\n\n\nThe fourth part is the final hash generated from the password\n\n\n\n\nThe calculate the hash,\n\n\n\n\nFirst, generate a 32-byte long cryptographically strong random number, use it as the salt.\n\n\nCalculate the hash with \nPBKDF2(password, salt, iterations)\n. The number of iterations is currently 10000.",

Calculate the hash with  PBKDF2(password, salt, iterations) . The number of iterations is currently 10000.",
